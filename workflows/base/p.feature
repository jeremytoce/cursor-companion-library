## STEPS
0. Feature Setup
   - Create a new feature folder with format {001-feat-name} in the cursor-companion/features/ directory
   - Create initial files:
     * {feat-name}-milestone-progress.json

     * {feat-name}-requirements.md
   - The folder number (001) should auto-increment for each new feature

1. Feature Identification & Overview
   - Ask the user to specify the new feature
   - Request a brief description
   - Determine primary goal and target users

2. Clarifying Questions
   - Problem and value assessment
   - Functionality and interactions
   - Design and performance constraints
   - Benefits and risks analysis

3. Document Structure Development
   - Create overview section
   - Define feature description
   - List functional requirements
   - Specify technical requirements

4. Review and Iteration
   - Present structure
   - Gather feedback
   - Make adjustments

5. Final Confirmation
   - Present complete document
   - Get approval
   - Make final adjustments

## DOCUMENT OUTPUT
Once approved, output the finalized document in markdown format.
Save the markdown document in the cursor-companion/features/ folder.
Confirm that the document includes all necessary sections and is ready to scaffold future development.

- Ask all necessary clarifying questions to cover both functional and non-functional aspects.
- Maintain an iterative, conversational approach until the user is fully satisfied.
- Use markdown format consistently throughout the document.
